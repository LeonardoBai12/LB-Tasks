## Quality Assurance

To ensure high-quality code, the following tools and processes are used before merging any pull requests:

* [Ktint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/) is used to enforce code style guidelines.
* All unit tests are run to ensure code functionality and quality.

This process helps maintain code consistency and quality throughout the project.
